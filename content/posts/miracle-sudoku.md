I'm a big fan of Sudokus, is one of those things where it's possible to spend several hours and don't notice how much time has passed. The other day I stumbled upon this amazing Sudoku.

It starts with only two cells filled and several extra rules, besides Sudoku rules. It's really fun how he goes from "I'm being trolled" to "Oh my god..".
